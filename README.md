# Flatland 2

This is a fork of [Flatland](https://github.com/avidbots/flatland) modified to
work on [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/The-ROS2-Project.html) natively
(not using [ROS 1 bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge)). The development
targeted [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/The-ROS2-Project.html),
which was the latest release of
[ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/The-ROS2-Project.html) at the time of
writing.

## What is Flatland?

- Flatland is a performance centric 2D robot simulator
- It is useful for simple simulations that don't require 3D capabilities
- It allows for time acceleration, which is useful for reinforcement learning
